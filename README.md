Working on a project for a client and a journal of what was worked on and the code commit of the working code

$project
========

This project has many webpages and will navigate across all of its webpages for a client and it represents their Country Club. Basic information about this establiment is demonstrated in the project. Everything that the client wanted is shown in the website. The only things that I wanted to add were a individual section for the Member's login between the gallery and blog sections and maybe fix up the Blog page, make the comments section work, and make a modal for the gallery photos.

Features
--------

- Nagivation
- Header with Member's Login / RSVP
- Footer with contact information
- 6 different pages with more detail about the client
- Media, Photos, and a working Gallery
- Blog with comments
